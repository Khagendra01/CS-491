##### any contributer can contribute here  #####

#### you can make your own algorithm just follow the py file name which  is dev { your firstname underscore symbol last name }
### and follow the rest guideline

## first read the helper.txt from the helper.txt from the docs folder which is in the main directory
## Then your algorithm should mainly focus on pasting part. So, if pasting part is done from the "question text" or within the current code then, it is acceptable or else
## the assignment will be considered invalid. 

## That is one of the required constraints for the human algorithm, you are free to implement anything else, you would like to
